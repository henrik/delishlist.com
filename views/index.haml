    %dt Ratings.
    %dd
      %p Tags like <code class="tags">*</code>, <code class="tags">***</code> etc become ratings. Want ratings to go to three stars, or five, or ten? Just tag it that way.

    %dt Sort.
    %dd
      %p Sort the list by highest rating or most recently added.

    %dt Filter by tags.
    %dd
      %p See only things with a tag (like <code class="tags">book</code>) or several (<code class="tags">book+art</code>), just like on Delicious. This can be used for things like per-event lists (<code class="tags">wedding</code>) , per-giver lists (<code class="tags">parents</code>), both (<code class="tags">wedding+parents</code>) or something else entirely.

    %dt Images.
    %dd
      %p Items are automatically thumbnailed by matching URLs to images for some popular sites, such as Amazon. 
      %p
        You can also set thumbnails manually: hover the item name to show the toolbar, then click the
        = image_tag('picture.png', :alt => 'picture')
        symbol.
        
      %p Hover a thumbnail to show it enlarged; click a thumbnail to make the enlarged image stay put.

    %dt Rich descriptions.
    %dd
      %p If the link description contains something like <code class="example">â‚¬12</code> or <code class="example">~$12.3 USD</code>, it's assumed to be the price and is emphasized.
      %p Quoted sentences in the description, like <code class="example">"An example."</code> are assumed to be quotes from the linked site and are shown in italics.

    %dt Note and address.
    %dd
      %p
        If there is a <code class="tags">wishlist</code> 
        = delicious_link("tag description", "/help/faq#tagDescriptions"), ","
        it's displayed alongside your list as a note. This is a good place to put your size in clothes etc.
      %p If the note contains dates like <code class="example">July 26</code>, a countdown like <code class="example">(in 3 days)</code> will be appended. Good for birthdays and other giftable events.
      %p If the tag description contains a paragraph with <code class="example">Address:</code> as the first line, that address is displayed under a header of its own.

    %dt Link, edit and remove.
    %dd
      %p Hover the cursor over an item to show the toolbar.
      %p
        Click 
        = image_tag('anchor.png', :alt => 'link')
        for a link to that specific item, that you can share.
      %p
        If you're logged in as this user on Delicious, click
        = image_tag('pencil.png', :alt => 'edit')
        for an edit/remove overlay.
      %p
        == (Lists are cached for #{CACHE_MINUTES} minutes, but the cache should expire when you edit or remove from the overlay.)
