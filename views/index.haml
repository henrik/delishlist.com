    Welcome to Delishlist! You can't sign up; we simply mirror bookmarks from
    = delicious_link, ","
    wrapped in better presentation.
  
  %form{ :action => '', :method => 'get' }
    %p
      Want a list?
      = link_to("Sign up on Delicious", "https://secure.delicious.com/register"), ","
      add links tagged <code class="tags">wishlist</code>, then point your browser
      = "(and your %s!)" % link_to("sugar daddy", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#Slang_terms")
      to <code>delishlist.com/</code><input type="text" name="name" id="name" value="username" />.
    %p
      You can, of course, view
      = delicious_link("someone else's wishlist", '/tag/wishlist')
      even if they never heard of this site.
      
    %p
      For performance reasons, lists are cached for 5 minutes. This means new items or edits may not appear instantly.
      
  %h2 Free as in ads
  
  %p There are some Google Ads in the sidebar of each list, and Amazon links become referral links (but are not altered on Delicious, of course).

  %dd
    %dt Ratings.
    %dd Tags like <code class="tags">*</code>, <code class="tags">***</code> etc become ratings. Want ratings to go to three stars? Five? Ten? Just tag it that way.
    %dt Sort.
    %dd Sort the list by highest rating or most recently added.
    %dt Filter by tags.
    %dd See only things with a tag (like <code class="tags">book</code>) or several (<code class="tags">book+art</code>), just like on Delicious. This can be used for things like per-event lists (<code>/username/wedding</code>) , per-giver lists (<code>/username/parents</code>) or per-event-and-giver: <code>/username/wedding+parents</code>.
    -#%dt Live search.
    -#%dd Enter a search string, and only matching (in title, description and tags) items are displayed, live.
    %dt Images.
    %dd
      %p Items are automatically thumbnailed by matching URLs to images for some popular sites, such as Amazon. 
      %p
        You can also set thumbnails manually: hover the item name to show the toolbar, then click the
        = image_tag('picture.png', :alt => 'picture')
        symbol.
        
      %p Hover a thumbnail to show it enlarged; click a thumbnail to make the enlarged image stay put.
      
    %dt Rich descriptions.
    %dd
      %p If the description contains something like <code class="example">â‚¬12</code> or <code class="example">$12.3 USD</code>, it's assumed to be the price and is emphasized. <code class="example">~250 SEK</code> is fine too, when you want to be vague.
      %p Quoted sentences in the description are assumed to be quotes from the linked site and are shown in italics.
    %dt Note and address.
    %dd
      %p
        If there is a <code class="tags">wishlist</code> 
        = delicious_link("tag description", "/help/tagdescriptions"), ","
        it's displayed alongside your list as a note. This is a good place to put your size in clothes etc.
      %p If the note contains dates like <code class="example">July 26</code>, a countdown like <code class="example">(in 3 days)</code> will be appended. Good for birthdays and other giftable events.
      %p If the tag description contains a paragraph with <code class="example">Address:</code> as the first line, that address is displayed under a header of its own.
    %dt Link, edit and clone.
    %dd
      %p Hover the cursor over an item to show the toolbar.
      %p
        Click the
        = image_tag('anchor.png', :alt => 'anchor')
        symbol for a link to that specific item.
      %p
        If you're logged in as this user on Delicious, click
        = image_tag('pencil.png', :alt => 'pencil')
        for their edit/remove page.
      %p
        If you're logged in on Delicious, click
        = image_tag('add.png', :alt => 'add')
        to add the same item to <em>your</em> list.
      %p
        Note that you won't see edits and added items on your list until the cache has expired and the page  been reloaded.
